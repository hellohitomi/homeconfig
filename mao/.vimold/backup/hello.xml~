# Bengaluru

The name **Bangalore** is an anglicised version of the city's name in
the Kannada language, Bengaluru.

> A popular anecdote (although one contradicted by historical
> evidence) recounts that the 11th-century Hoysala king Veera Ballala
> II, while on a hunting expedition, lost his way in the forest. Tired
> and hungry, he came across a poor old woman who served him boiled
> beans. The grateful king named the place _"benda kaal-ooru"_
> (literally, "town of boiled beans"), which was eventually
> colloquialised to "Bengaluru".
