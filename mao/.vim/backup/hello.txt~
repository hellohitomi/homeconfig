I have coined a phrase for myself - 'CUT to the G':

1. Concentrate
2. Understand
3. Think
4. Get Things Done

1. Concentrate

4. Get Things Done

1. Concentrate

Seep 4 is eventually what gets you moving, but Steps 2 and 3 are equally important. As Abraham Lincoln once said "If I had eight hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend six hours sharpening my axe." And to get to this stage, you need to do Step 1 which boils down to one thing - It's all in the mind. That's why it's so hard.
